<h1 id="system-scope-and-context">System Scope and Context</h1>
<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>
<p>System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners (neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.</p>
<p>If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system’s most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.</p>
<p><strong>Form</strong></p>
<p>Various options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Context diagrams</li>
<li>Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-context">Business Context</h2>
<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>
<p>Specification of <strong>all</strong> communication partners (users, IT-systems, …) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces. Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Form</strong></p>
<p>All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.</p>
<p>Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table. The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Diagram or Table&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;optionally: Explanation of external domain interfaces&gt;</strong></p>
<h2 id="technical-context">Technical Context</h2>
<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>
<p>Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Form</strong></p>
<p>E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems, together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Diagram or Table&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;optionally: Explanation of technical interfaces&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;Mapping Input/Output to Channels&gt;</strong></p>
