<h1 id="quality-requirements">Quality Requirements</h1>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<p>This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)</p>
<p>Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority, which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them, concrete and measurable.</p>
<h2 id="quality-tree">Quality Tree</h2>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<p>The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Form</strong></p>
<p>The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root</li>
<li>a mind map with quality categories as main branches</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.</p>
<h2 id="quality-scenarios">Quality Scenarios</h2>
<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>
<p>Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.</p>
<p>These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.</p>
<p>For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.</li>
<li>Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.</p>
<p>Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2) more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.</p>
