# Introduction and Goals

## Requirements Overview

The goal is to create a small game, representing the functionality of the
engine. It should run reasonably well. Any kind of underlying game design, such
as level design, UX and such are not to be considered at the current stage, as
our only focus is the underlying engine.

## Quality Goals

1. Good performance of engine
    - Example: High framerate, responsive UI
2. Clean codebase with documentation
    - Example: Easy to understand code, with documentation viewable on a website
3. Stability of the engine
    - Example: No crashes upon various actions with the engine window
